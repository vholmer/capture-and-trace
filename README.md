# Introduction
Hey! This game was made for Ludum Dare 46 by [LiquidFunk](https://ldjam.com/users/liquidfunk/) and [Lukas018](https://ldjam.com/users/lukas/) using the fantasy console [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)!

# Capture & Trace

Capture & Trace takes place inside a fictional city in which a disease is spreading. The problem? It is virtually impossible to detect it. That's where you come in. Your job? Capture & Trace citizens. How you ask? It's easy!

## Instructions

The game takes place in cycles where the simulation runs. After each cycle, it is yours, the player's, turn. You have two tools to utilize each turn which both cost *action points* to use. *Capturing* costs 5 action points. *Tracing* costs 10 action points.

### Capturing

Click capture and then click on a citizen. They will immediately be transported to *The Hall* where they can be examined.

### Tracing

Click trace and then click on a captured citizen inside *The Hall*. If the citizen is infected a *trace line* will appear to the citizen that infected the clicked-on citizen. Trace that same captured citizen again and the trace will go one level deeper, tracing who infected the citizen that infected the captured citizen and so on. If no further trace lines appears, great! You found patient zero. Capture them to win!

### Winning

Use *trace* to find patient zero and capture them to win!


### Losing

If all of the citizens are infected, you lose.
